      PetMe may aid in serving as a mediatory platform between a pet owner and a willing caretaker on a payment-based system.

This mediation mentioned, includes in it creation of profiles from both sides i.e. the pet owners as well as a willing caretaker.
Pet owners can put on an advertisement for when, they'll be in need of their pet being taken care of, then the caretakers can simply reach out to the guardians of the pet through messaging medium.

With the help of such a reliable platform, pet owners may not need to be too concerned about their pet's well-being in their busy hours and also they can keep tabs on their little oneâ€™s health as well as get in contact with a vet during unforeseen situations. 
PetMe would be a web application, which means it could be accessed through any device with internet connectivity.
The platform would be free as of now, we are thinking to implement Freemium Business Model. 
All of the important content, such as services, reminders and the features aforementioned would be accessible from the dashboard and it is primarily designed for pet owners/guardians.
The prototype could have various key features included, but along with considerations of missing features or limitations as well, as it is in baby stage.

      <p class="disc">In this fast growing world most of us spend most of the time behind the job culture, due to which the proper attention and care of the pets is left unnoticed, which affects the health of the pets. Pets require an everyday walk and food on time but it is not possible for all the people. So, if you have someone who will take care of your pet for you, how does it sound? </p>
